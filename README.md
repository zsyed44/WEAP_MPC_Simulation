# WEAP_MPC_Simulation

**I AM PLANNING TO ADD A DRAWING SYSTEM, ALLOWING US TO TEST CUSTOM TRACKS**

This is a place for me to store an MPC controller code that I am working on for Western Engineering AutoPilot.

All code in this repository is heavilly based on the code and notebook resources provided by [this repository](https://github.com/mcarfagno/mpc_python)

When the code is done, md file(s) and other relevant documentation will be updated
